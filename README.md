# 💻 Lambda Expressions in Java

This repository demonstrates the **concept of Lambda Expressions** in Java — a feature introduced in **Java 8** that enables functional programming by allowing you to write cleaner, more concise code.

# 💡 What is a Lambda Expression?

A Lambda Expression is a short block of code that takes in parameters and returns a value.
Lambdas are used primarily to define inline implementations of functional interfaces.
```
() -> System.out.println("Hello Lambda");
```

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project includes two main approaches:

1. **Traditional Interface Implementation** — Using a separate class (`MyInterImplement`) that implements an interface (`MyInter`).
2. **Lambda Expression Approach** — Using a lambda expression to provide the implementation inline without creating a separate class.
